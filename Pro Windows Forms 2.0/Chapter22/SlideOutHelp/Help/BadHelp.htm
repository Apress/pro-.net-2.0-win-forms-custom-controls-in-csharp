<h1>Bad Help</h1>
<p>Have you ever had this experience? You find an unusual option buried deep in an application, and it piques your curiosity. You hit F1, curious to find out what this option accomplishes. But your optimism dwindles when you read the description provided by the context-sensitive Help system: "To enable option X, click once on the option X check box. To disable option X, click the option X check box again to remove the check mark. Click OK to save your changes."</p>
<p>Clearly something is missing here. You want to know what option X does; the Help wants to explain, in oddly explicit detail, how to use a check box. The situation is ridiculous, as the function of option X is not at all obvious, but the way to use a check box is an instinctive part of every computer user’s understanding. If you don’t know how to use a check box, you probably wouldn’t have guessed to press the F1 key for help.</p>
<p>This is an example of classic bad help.</p>
