<h1>The Value of Help</h1>
<p>In recent years there has been a shift away from printed documentation. The occasional weighty manual (like the book you’re holding now) is still required for learning advanced tools, but the average piece of office productivity or business software no longer assumes the user is willing to perform any additional reading. Instead, these programs are heavily dependent on natural, instinctive interfaces, and use online Help to patch the gaps and answer the occasional user question.</p>
