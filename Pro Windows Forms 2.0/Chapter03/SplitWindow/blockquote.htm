<p>Some words of wisdom from "A Tale of Two Cities":</p>
<blockquote>
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of 
wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the 
epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, 
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything 
before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were 
all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present 
period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, 
for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

<p>It's amazing what you can fit into one sentence. Typing that much in
one go can seriously tire the wrist. Did they have carpal tunnel syndrome
in the nineteenth century?</p>
